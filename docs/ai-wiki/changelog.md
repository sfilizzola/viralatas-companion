## 2026-05-11 (Badge Asset Wiring)

### Added
- Wired five badge assets into `BADGES`: `bbq-king-2026`, `dreamer`, `jagger-king`, `live-beast`, and `total-kaput-2026`.
- Added badge localization keys for Brazilian Portuguese, English, Spanish, and German.

### Changed
- Updated the badge inventory to 28 active badges and documented `dreamer` as a persisted 30-pick milestone.
- Updated the `dreamer` badge display copy to use the "I'm Tripping" / "Tô doidão" concept across locales.
- Removed the unused `badge_camping_mob.png` test asset from the active badge asset folder.

### Architectural Notes
- `dreamer` uses the existing `persist: true` badge mechanism so it remains earned after the user later changes picks.
- The new honor badges use the existing `assigned` condition and godlike assignment flow.

## 2026-05-11 (Phase 13.B)

### Added (User Flows)
- **flows/live-now.md** — Live band display: time model (festival-local CEST), current/next band selection algorithm, conflict severity (hard >15min / soft ≤15min), crew grouping (by band → camping → metal place → lost), presence states (camping, metal place time window, auto-checkout), godlike test mode (splice virtual band at now), realtime presence updates (~3s), edge cases (band ends at now, multiple picks both current, timezone wrapping, stale offline state), performance memoization, known limitations (hard-coded CEST, no auto-seen tracking), future improvements

---

## 2026-05-11 (Phase 13.A)

### Added (User Flows)
- **flows/announcements.md** — Complete post lifecycle: happy path (online), offline queueing & flushing, realtime propagation to other users, soft-delete with RLS enforcement, moderation (manager/godlike), edge cases (post-delete race, blocked posters, flaky network, retry idempotency), known issues (blocked poster RLS missing, no dedup on retry), future improvements

---

## 2026-05-11 (Continued)

### Added (Features & Systems)
- **badges.md** — Badge system: 22+ condition types (Wacken history, profile, arrival, band picks/seen, location, assigned), current 30 badges, step-by-step guide to add new badges, localization (4 languages), testing patterns, edge cases, persist vs. conditional badge semantics

### Architectural Discoveries
- IndexedDB has 13 object stores (data + queues + config)
- Queue stores are separate from data stores (offline_picks distinct from user_picks)
- Deduplication groups by (user_id, band_id) and keeps only last action
- Realtime subscriptions are per-hook and clean up on unmount
- Auth session persisted to IndexedDB via custom Supabase storage adapter
- Event emitters (window events) used instead of Redux/Context for state updates
- BandSync runs once on init, not re-run on reconnect (band list immutable)
- Cache version bump wiped all local data, used for lineup invalidation
- Each repository exposes a public interface with sync + queue flush methods
- Workbox caching strategy: NetworkFirst for Supabase, CacheFirst for band images

### Structure
- `/flows/` folder created for user flow documentation
- `/decisions/` folder created for architectural decision records
- Template established for flow documents (Purpose, Trigger, Happy Path, Offline Behavior, Sync Behavior, Source Files, Diagrams, Edge Cases)

## 2026-05-11 (Initial Session)

### Added (Core Architecture)
- **index.md** — Navigation hub, system diagram, architecture principles, reading order
- **architecture.md** — 4-layer design, data flows (online/offline/realtime), repositories, offline behavior, sync mechanisms
- **domain-model.md** — Entities (User, Band, UserPick, UserPresence, Announcement, etc.), relationships, business rules by role
- **offline-first.md** — Golden rule (IDB primary), queue design, deduplication mechanics, example lifetimes, guarantees per data type, Service Worker caching
- **sync-engine.md** — Sync orchestration (4 components), queue flush flow, realtime subscription flow, app init flow, key sync functions, error handling, monitoring
- **routes.md** — All 6 routes, page components, navigation flows (login → /now, browse → pick, post announcement), error handling per route
- **testing.md** — Unit/integration/offline testing, manual test scenarios (offline pick/announcement/dedup), testing offline behavior, badge/time logic tests
- **glossary.md** — 100+ terms: architecture, database, React, auth, data, sync, UI, time, badge, role, testing

---

## Future

### TBD (Flows & Decisions)
- **flows/offline-pick-sync.md** — Queue mechanics, reconnect behavior, error recovery
- **flows/live-now.md** — Time-based band display, conflicts, crew attendance
- **flows/announcements.md** — Post, realtime, soft-delete, moderation
- **flows/authentication.md** — Login, signup, session persistence, test users
- **decisions/supabase-as-sync-target.md** — Why Supabase (auth + DB + realtime), alternatives considered
