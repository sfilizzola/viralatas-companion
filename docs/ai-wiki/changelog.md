## 2026-05-13 (Badge: roots — Sepultura farewell witness)

### Added
- **`roots` badge** — "Roots, Bloody Roots". Awarded via `band_seen_named: 'Sepultura'`, year 2026. Sepultura plays HAR6 on Day 3 (Friday, July 31, 19:00–20:30) and is on their farewell tour, so this badge commemorates witnessing the goodbye of a legendary Brazilian metal act. Image already present at `public/badges/badge_roots.png`. Internal "Dani" reference in the description is an inside joke for the vira-latas.

### Changed
- **`src/services/badges/registry.ts`** — Appended the `roots` BadgeConfig after `alestorm` (both are `band_seen_named` festival-2026 badges, grouped together).
- **`src/i18n/Badges_br.json`, `Badges_en.json`, `Badges_es.json`, `Badges_de.json`** — Added `badgeRoots` (label, kept as "Roots, Bloody Roots" in all 4 languages per request — it's a song title) and `badgeRootsDescription` (translated description "You saw the farewell of an amazing band, right Dani?" into BR/EN/ES/DE).
- **`docs/ai-wiki/badges.md`** — Bumped inventory count 28 → 29; expanded "Festival 2026" section 7 → 8 entries with the `roots` line referencing the Sepultura HAR6 slot.

### Architectural Notes
- The `roots` condition uses `band_seen_named` (exact case-sensitive match on `Band.name`), the same pattern as `alestorm`. The badge is automatically earned once Sepultura's `end_time` passes and the user has not opted out via the "didn't see" toggle.
- Distinct from any future `groove-metal` genre badge (Sepultura's genre is `Groove Metal` in `supabase/seed/bands.ts`): this badge is band-specific, tied to the farewell-tour narrative rather than the genre.

---

## 2026-05-13 (Docs: badge paths + Party Metal context)

### Changed
- **badges.md** — Refreshed the `party-metal` inventory line to reflect that the genre now belongs to exactly 2 bands (Alestorm + Airbourne), so the badge is a "see both" objective for Day 4. Added a new "Genres present in lineup with NO corresponding badge" section explicitly noting that `Pirate Metal` has no badge (only `Mr. Hurley und die Pulveraffen` carries it). Fixed stale `src/services/badges.ts` path to `src/services/badges/registry.ts`. Bumped Last updated.
- **CLAUDE.md** — Fixed badge section to point at `src/services/badges/registry.ts` (was `src/services/badges.ts`/`src/lib/badges.ts` — both old paths). Expanded i18n note from "br + en" to "br, en, es, de" matching the actual file layout.

### Architectural Notes
- The `party-metal` badge being calibrated to exactly the existing Party-Metal band count is intentional going forward — adding a 3rd Party Metal band to the lineup would make the badge easier to earn without code changes; check this when curating future lineups.

### Changed
- **lineup.md** — Two slot swaps and two genre updates:
  - **Day 3:** Emperor (Black Metal) ↔ Sepultura (Groove Metal). Sepultura now headlines HAR6 (Harder 19:00–20:30); Emperor moves to LOU19 (Louder 22:45–00:00*).
  - **Day 4:** Triptykon (Black / Doom Metal) ↔ Alestorm. Alestorm now plays FAS16 (Faster 19:15–20:45); Triptykon moves to LOU26 (Louder 20:45–22:00).
  - **Alestorm:** genre changed from `Pirate Metal` to `Party Metal`.
  - **Airbourne:** genre changed from `Hard Rock` to `Party Metal`.
- **supabase/seed/bands.ts** — Mirrored all four changes from lineup.md. 173-row total unchanged. Verified no UNIQUE(stage, start_time, name) collisions.

### Architectural Notes
- Band image URLs follow the band when they swap slots, not the slot.
- Badge impact (verified against `src/services/badges/registry.ts`):
  - `party-metal` badge (`bands_seen_genre_min: 'Party Metal', count: 2`) is now perfectly calibrated: exactly 2 bands carry this genre — `Alestorm` (FAS16 Day 4, 19:15–20:45) and `Airbourne` (HAR11 Day 4, 21:00–22:30). The badge effectively requires seeing both. Slots don't overlap, so it's reachable in one Day-4 evening.
  - There is **no** `pirate-metal` badge. The only Pirate Metal band remaining (`Mr. Hurley und die Pulveraffen`, WAK17 Day 3) is not referenced by any badge. The `alestorm` badge uses `band_seen_named` against the band name `Alestorm`, not the genre — unaffected by the genre change.

---

## 2026-05-13 (Seed: bands.ts destructive guarantees hardened)

### Changed
- **supabase/seed/bands.ts** — Rewrote the `seed()` runner to make the destructive replace-all behavior provably correct:
  - Prints existing row count, target Supabase URL, and the full cascade impact (`user_picks`, `user_missed_bands`, `live_band_test_config.band_id`) before doing anything.
  - 5-second abort window (Ctrl-C) before the first DELETE; skip with `--force` for CI/scripts.
  - DELETE filter changed from `.not('id', 'is', null)` to `.gte('start_time', '1900-01-01T00:00:00Z')` — semantically equivalent (matches every row, since `start_time` is `NOT NULL`) but explicit about intent and never confuses the postgrest planner.
  - Post-DELETE verification: aborts if the table is not empty.
  - Post-INSERT verification: aborts if row count doesn't equal `bands.length` (173).
  - File header docs the full destructive contract: which tables cascade, which set null, which records get lost, when not to run it.

### Architectural Notes
- All FKs that reference `bands.id` are accounted for: `user_picks` (CASCADE), `user_missed_bands` (CASCADE), `live_band_test_config.band_id` (SET NULL). No other tables reference `bands.id`, so DELETE cannot be blocked by FK violations.
- The `bands` UNIQUE constraint is `(stage, start_time, name)` — verified that all 173 seed rows have distinct tuples on those three columns, so re-seeding never collides with itself.

---

## 2026-05-13 (Seed: bands.ts rebuilt from lineup.md)

### Changed
- **supabase/seed/bands.ts** — Full rewrite to mirror `docs/ai-wiki/lineup.md` exactly. 173 bands seeded (192 listed in lineup.md minus 19 slots whose band name is literally `TBD`). Slot start/end times pulled directly from `docs/ai-wiki/stages.md` Slot IDs. Bands with `Band Status: TBD` keep their name but use a `PLACEHOLDER` image URL (8 rows). Bands with `Genre: TBD` use a `Generic Metal` fallback genre (42 rows = 38 unique bands, plus recurring acts like `Sir Henry Hot Memorial` ×4 and `Wacken Firefighters` ×2). Each band row is annotated with its Slot ID for cross-reference.

### Architectural Notes
- The fallback genre constant `TBD_GENRE = 'Generic Metal'` lives at the top of `bands.ts` — if the policy for unresolved genres changes, edit that single constant.
- Dropped Slot IDs (band name = TBD, 19 total): Day 1 — `HBA7`, `WAS1`, `WAS2`, `WAS3`, `WAK2`; Day 2 — `WET13`, `WET14`, `WET15`, `WET16`, `HBA13`, `HBA14`, `HBA15`, `WAS8`, `WAS9`, `WAK8`, `WAK9`; Day 4 — `HBA29`, `WAK23`, `WAS23`.
- Name corrections from previous bands.ts to match lineup.md exactly: `Alien Rockin' Explosion` → `Alien Rockin Explosion`, `Broken by the Scream` → `Broken By The Scream`, `Tuxedoo` → `tuXedoo`, `Of Mice & Men` → `Of Mice and Men`, `Sventevith` → `Misþyrming & Nergal`, `Dieter Maschine Birr` → `Dieter "Maschine" Birr`, `Cowgirls From Hell DJ Team` → `Cowgirls From Hell`.
- `WAS26 President` flipped to `Band Status: TBD` in lineup.md → now uses PLACEHOLDER image while keeping `Metal` genre.

---

## 2026-05-13 (Lineup: Day 4 Saturday reorganization — corrected algorithm)

### Changed
- **lineup.md** — Rewrote Day 4 (Saturday, 1 August 2026) band assignments using the corrected importance-rank algorithm from the official Wacken 2026 Saturday poster. Group A (Faster, Harder, Louder = 18 slots) is exhausted completely with bands #1–#18 before any Group B assignment begins. Group B (W.E.T., Headbangers, Wackinger, Wasteland, Jungle = 30 slots) receives bands #19–#45. 45 bands mapped to 48 slots; 3 slots remain TBD (HBA29, WAK22, WAS23). Slot IDs corrected to match stages.md (previous Day 4 used wrong IDs such as HAR16–HAR21, FAS21–FAS34, etc.). Summary updated to 75 CONFIRMED · 94 TBD · 169 total.

### Architectural Notes
- Day 4 Group A headliners: Sabaton → FAS18, Powerwolf → HAR12, Arch Enemy → LOU27. Group A completely absorbs the top 18 importance-ranked bands, meaning all three Louder stage closers (Arch Enemy, Alestorm, Nevermore) are in Group A, not Group B.
- Group B last-slot headliners: Dritte Wahl → WET35, Einherjer → HBA35, Finsterforst → WAK28, Fit For An Autopsy → WAS29, Focus. → JUN8.
- Wacken Firefighters and Sir Henry Hot Memorial appear on both Day 1/2/3 and Day 4 — these are recurring daily acts; they are intentionally kept in all days they appear.

---

## 2026-05-13 (Lineup: Day 3 Friday reorganization — corrected algorithm)

### Changed
- **lineup.md** — Rewrote Day 3 (Friday, 31 July 2026) band assignments using the corrected importance-rank algorithm from the official Wacken 2026 Friday poster. Group A (Faster, Harder, Louder — 17 slots) filled completely first, then Group B (W.E.T., Headbangers, Wackinger, Wasteland, Welcome to the Jungle — 30 slots). All 47 bands placed across 47 Day 3 slots with correct `stages.md` slot IDs (FAS8–FAS12, HAR4–HAR7, LOU13–LOU20, WET23–WET29, HBA22–HBA28, WAK15–WAK21, WAS15–WAS22, JUN5).

### Architectural Notes
- Group A headliner chain: Judas Priest→FAS12, In Flames→HAR7, Running Wild→LOU20; Saxon→FAS11, Emperor→HAR6, Sepultura→LOU19.
- Group B headliner chain: Chaosbay→WET29, Crematory→HBA28, Cruachan→WAK21, Cursed Abyss→WAS22, Deafheaven→JUN5 (only slot).

---

## 2026-05-13 (Wiki: Stages/Lineup Split)

### Added
- **stages.md** (new) — Authoritative reference for the 8 Wacken 2026 stages: stage table (name, abbreviation, category, UI color, hex), stage pairing rule (Harder↔Faster, W.E.T.↔Headbangers physical adjacency), reference keys (stage abbreviations, day codes D1–D4, overnight codes D1n–D4n, slot confirmation status), slot ID scheme (range per stage), all stage schedule grids (start/end times per slot per day for all 8 stages), how stages link to bands (Band type mapping, bands.ts field table), maintenance guides for confirming slot times and adding new slots.

### Changed
- **lineup.md** — Removed stage schedules, reference keys, stage pairing rule, and slot ID scheme (all moved to stages.md). Now focused exclusively on band assignments. Added cross-references to stages.md via Slot IDs throughout. Maintenance guide updated to link out to stages.md for slot and schedule operations.
- **glossary.md** — Added 7 new terms: `Band Assignment`, `Stage`, `Stage Category`, `Stage Pairing`, `Stage Schedule`, `Slot ID`. Updated existing `Band` entry to clarify stage is a string attribute (not a foreign key). Updated `Stage Color` entry with CSS variable detail and reference to stages.md.
- **index.md** — Added "Festival Content" section to Quick Navigation with links to both stages.md and lineup.md. Updated Domain Overview to clarify stage is not a DB entity. Added Stage Colors and Band Seed rows to Key Files table. Updated last edited date.

### Architectural Notes
- Stage is **not a DB entity**: `Band.stage` is a plain string. All stage metadata (colors, schedules, pairing) lives in source constants and wiki docs, not in the database.
- The Slot ID scheme (e.g. `FAS1`, `HAR7`) is the link between `stages.md` (times) and `lineup.md` (bands). When updating either file, keep Slot IDs consistent across both.
- `stageColors.ts` returns CSS variable tokens (`var(--stage-faster)`), not raw hex values; hex lives in `index.css`.

---

## 2026-05-12 (Planning: remaining test stages moved to FUTURE_IDEAS)

### Changed
- `FUTURE_IDEAS.md` — added Ideas 3, 4, 5: unit tests for IDB layer (`lib/db.ts`), hook logic (pure memoized computations), and component/page integration; migrated from `UNIT_TEST_PLAN.md` Stages 4–6 plus the Vitest config threshold block and `fake-indexeddb` requirement.
- `UNIT_TEST_PLAN.md` deleted — completed stages (1–3) are recorded in this changelog; remaining stages (4–6) are now tracked in `FUTURE_IDEAS.md` as Ideas 3–5.

### Architectural Notes
- No code or schema changes in this entry; purely planning/housekeeping.

---

## 2026-05-12 (UNIT_TEST_PLAN Stage 3)

### Added
- `src/__tests__/picksRepository.test.ts` — 26 tests for `toggle()` (online/offline/error), `flushOfflineQueue()` (empty queue, dedup, upsert/delete routing), and `syncCrewFromRemote()`
- `src/__tests__/presenceRepository.test.ts` — 11 tests for `setCampingStatus()` (online/offline), `isTimeWithinMetalPlaceWindow()` (time-range boundary), and `validateAndAutoCheckout()`
- `src/__tests__/announcementsRepository.test.ts` — 7 tests for online post, offline queue, and `flushPendingAnnouncements()`
- `src/__tests__/bandsRepository.test.ts` — 3 tests for `checkAndApplyCacheVersion()` (match/mismatch/no-data)
- `src/__tests__/missedRepository.test.ts` — 4 tests for mark/unmark online and offline

### Architectural Notes
- UNIT_TEST_PLAN Stage 3 complete: 51 new tests, 355 total, 0 failures.
- Mock pattern: `vi.hoisted()` required when vi.mock factory references named mock instances (Vitest hoisting constraint).
- Supabase fluent chains (`.delete().eq().eq()`, `.insert().select().single()`) required explicit nested vi.fn() chains.
- `navigator.onLine` overridden via `Object.defineProperty` with `configurable: true` for per-test reset.

---

## 2026-05-12 (UNIT_TEST_PLAN Stage 2)

### Added
- `src/__tests__/bandTime.test.ts` — 14 tests for `bandDay()` and `formatTime()` from `services/bandTime.ts`; covers CEST rollback boundary (04:00 CEST / 02:00 UTC), midnight crossover, and padding edge cases
- `src/__tests__/bandFilter.test.ts` — 14 tests for `filterBands()` from `services/bandFilter.ts`; covers day/stage/genre/query/upcoming filters, boundary conditions, and combined interactions
- `src/__tests__/scheduleFilterStorage.test.ts` — 12 tests for `loadStoredFilters`/`saveStoredFilters`; covers missing key, corrupted JSON, round-trip, and `query` strip-on-save behavior
- `src/__tests__/deduplicatePickQueue.test.ts` — 8 tests for `deduplicatePickQueue()` from `repositories/picks.ts`; covers keepLast semantics, cross-band/user independence, and empty input
- `src/__tests__/attendees.test.ts` — 8 tests for `computeAttendees()` from `services/attendees.ts`; covers grouping, hydration, missing-crew fallback label, and alphabetical sort
- `src/__tests__/stageColors.test.ts` — 30 tests for `services/stageColors.ts`; covers all 8 stage CSS variable tokens and unknown-stage fallback
- `src/__tests__/i18n.test.ts` — 13 tests for `lib/i18n.ts`; covers br/en/es/de lookup, missing-key fallback, placeholder interpolation, and out-of-provider error

### Architectural Notes
- UNIT_TEST_PLAN Stage 2 complete: 99 new tests, 304 total, 0 failures.
- Key discovery: `stageColors.ts` returns CSS variable strings (`var(--stage-faster)`), not raw hex values — hex lives in `index.css`.
- Key discovery: `t()` function lives inside the `useI18n` hook and requires React context; i18n tests use `renderHook` with a bare `I18nContext.Provider` wrapper.
- Key discovery: `scheduleFilterStorage` never persists `query` to localStorage — stripped on save, reset to `''` on load.

---

## 2026-05-12 (UNIT_TEST_PLAN Stage 1)

### Changed
- Extracted `filterBands(bands, filters, now)` from `SchedulePage.tsx` into `src/services/bandFilter.ts` (pure function, exported)
- Extracted `loadStoredFilters()` / `saveStoredFilters()` from `SchedulePage.tsx` into `src/services/scheduleFilterStorage.ts`
- Extracted `computeAttendees(picks, crewUsers)` from `useBandAttendees.ts` into `src/services/attendees.ts`; exported `BandAttendee` and `AttendeeMap` types
- Exported `deduplicatePickQueue(ops)` as a named pure function from `src/repositories/picks.ts`; `flushOfflineQueue` calls it internally
- Exported `countPicks` as a named pure function from `src/hooks/usePickCounts.ts`
- Rewrote `schedule.test.ts` to import `bandDay`/`formatTime` from real source files instead of duplicating helpers

### Architectural Notes
- UNIT_TEST_PLAN Stage 1 complete: all five low-risk pure function extractions done. No behavior changes. 205 tests pass.
- New testable surface: `bandFilter.ts`, `scheduleFilterStorage.ts`, `attendees.ts`, `deduplicatePickQueue`, `countPicks` are all now importable by unit tests without mounting hooks or pages.

---

## 2026-05-12 (Badge System Refactor)

### Changed
- `src/services/badges.ts` (deleted) — Monolithic 576-line file split into a `src/services/badges/` folder
- `src/services/badges/types.ts` (new) — All 4 type definitions: `BadgeBand`, `BadgeCondition`, `BadgeConfig`, `BadgeContext`
- `src/services/badges/engine.ts` (new) — Pure evaluation logic: `festivalLocalHour` helper, `buildBadgeContext`, `evaluateBadge`, `getEarnedBadges`
- `src/services/badges/registry.ts` (new) — `BADGES[]` array with all 26 badge definitions and the condition-examples developer reference comment block
- `src/services/badges/index.ts` (new) — Barrel re-export preserving all existing `from '…/services/badges'` import paths unchanged
- `docs/ai-wiki/badges.md` — Updated Key Files table to reflect new folder structure

### Architectural Notes
- All four consumers (`badges.test.ts`, `missed.test.ts`, `BadgesDisplay.tsx`, `AssignBadgeModal.tsx`) required zero import changes — the barrel index maintains backward compatibility
- Dependency order is strictly: `types.ts` ← `engine.ts` + `registry.ts` ← `index.ts` (no circular deps)

---

## 2026-05-12 (Password Recovery Flow)

### Added
- `src/pages/ResetPasswordPage.tsx` — New public page at `/reset-password`; listens for Supabase `PASSWORD_RECOVERY` auth event; two password fields (new + confirm) with mismatch validation; calls `supabase.auth.updateUser({ password })` on submit; navigates to `/now` on success; falls back to `getSession()` on page refresh
- i18n keys for forgot-password and reset-password in all 4 languages (`AuthPage_br.json`, `AuthPage_en.json`, `AuthPage_es.json`, `AuthPage_de.json`): `forgotPassword`, `forgotPasswordConfirm`, `sendResetLink`, `sendingResetLink`, `resetLinkSent`, `cancelAction`, `resetPasswordTitle`, `resetPasswordSubtitle`, `newPassword`, `confirmPassword`, `passwordsDoNotMatch`, `resetPasswordAction`, `resetPasswordLoading`, `resetPasswordSuccess`, `resetPasswordNoSession`

### Changed
- `src/pages/LoginPage.tsx` — Added "Forgot password?" link below login form; clicking it reveals an inline 3-step panel: `idle` → `confirm` (email input + Are you sure?) → `sent` (green confirmation); calls `supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail()` with `redirectTo: ${origin}/reset-password`
- `src/pages/AuthPage.module.css` — Added `.linkButton`, `.forgotBox`, `.forgotQuestion`, `.forgotActions`, `.buttonSecondary`, `.forgotSent` classes for the forgot-password panel and success state
- `src/App.tsx` — Added public `/reset-password` route (no `PrivateRoute` wrapper)
- `docs/ai-wiki/flows/authentication.md` — Added "Flow: Password Recovery" section (full timeline, Supabase token mechanics, Cassio in-joke note, localization key list); updated Triggers (3 entries), Relevant Source Files (added `ResetPasswordPage.tsx`, i18n files), `onAuthStateChange` events (added `PASSWORD_RECOVERY`), Route Guards (documented public routes), Known Limitations (removed stale "no password reset UI" item, added recovery-link single-use caveat)

### Architectural Notes
- `/reset-password` must be a **public route** — the user arrives unauthenticated from the email link; `PrivateRoute` would redirect them to `/login` before the recovery session is established
- The `PASSWORD_RECOVERY` `onAuthStateChange` event fires only once per tab (when the URL hash token is first exchanged); the `getSession()` fallback handles page refreshes
- "Cassio" is intentionally hard-coded in all 4 language files as a permanent in-joke and must never be replaced with a generic placeholder
- No schema changes required — Supabase manages the recovery token entirely server-side

---

## 2026-05-12 (Phases 13–15: Wiki Documentation Roadmap)

### Added (User Flows — Phase 13)
- **flows/offline-pick-sync.md** (13.C) — Complete queue mechanics: 13-store IDB structure, `OfflinePickOp` shape, online happy path, offline behavior with PendingChip, keepLast dedup algorithm, worked example (5 toggles T=0:10–T=0:30 → 1 Supabase call), sync trigger (login + 'online' event), error recovery table, realtime catch-up after reconnect, 5 edge cases (mid-write offline, concurrent sessions, deleted band, partial flush, large queue), known limitations (no enqueue-time dedup, no backoff, no TTL, `navigator.onLine` unreliability)
- **flows/authentication.md** (13.D) — Login/signup flows, custom IndexedDB auth storage adapter (`getItem`/`setItem`/`removeItem` via `loadSession`/`saveSession`), `handle_new_user()` trigger details and `coalesce()` fix, `useAuth()` lifecycle, session persistence scenarios (PWA open offline, token expiry, concurrent sessions), route guards (`PrivateRoute`), registration gate, test user creation, RLS policy table, offline scenarios, known limitations (no email verification, no password reset, hard-coded godlike email)

### Added (ADRs — Phase 14)
- **decisions/supabase-as-sync-target.md** (14.A) — Decision to use Supabase for auth + DB + realtime + edge functions; alternatives rejected (Firebase NoSQL mismatch, custom Node infra cost, PocketBase no hosted tier, CouchDB no auth); tradeoffs accepted (vendor lock-in, trigger complexity, RLS debugging)
- **decisions/custom-hooks-events-no-redux.md** (14.B) — Decision to use custom hooks + window events instead of Redux/Zustand/Context; rationale (IDB as source of truth requires out-of-React mutation notification); hook lifecycle pattern; when NOT to use (multi-step forms, complex derived state); tradeoffs (no time-travel debugging, no cross-tab sync)
- **decisions/workbox-caching-strategy.md** (14.C) — NetworkFirst for Supabase (24h cache, freshness priority), CacheFirst for Wacken band images (30-day TTL, opaque CORS caching with `statuses: [0, 200]`), precaching for app shell (versioned filenames, `autoUpdate`, `skipWaiting`+`clientsClaim`); alternatives considered; cache invalidation mechanics

### Changed (Glossary — Phase 15.A)
- **glossary.md** expanded from ~100 to 140+ terms: added 40+ new terms covering offline pick lifecycle, keepLast semantics, opaque responses, precache, NetworkFirst, CacheFirst, StaleWhileRevalidate, cache TTL, Service Worker lifecycle, autoUpdate, clientsClaim, content hash, flushPending, draft announcement, server-assigned ID, JWT, refresh token, custom auth storage adapter, handle_new_user trigger, coalesce() fix, security definer, auth state events, LivePlan status, applyLiveBandTestOverride, CrewLiveGroup, Metal Place Window, validateAndAutoCheckout, soft/hard conflict, 3-conflict banner, vendor lock-in, set_user_role RPC, wipeAllLocalData, CacheVersionCheck, emitSyncComplete, graceful degradation, reading path

### Changed (Index — Phase 15.B)
- **index.md** updated: Quick Navigation now lists all 19 wiki documents (11 core + 1 badges + 5 flows + 5 decisions); added "Architectural Decisions" section; 7 reading paths by role (First-Time Engineer, Badge Developer, Offline Expert, Auth & User Management, Announcements/Moderation, Architecture Decision Context, Live Now Page); `Recommended Reading Order` section replaced by detailed `Reading Paths`; `Last Edited` updated to 2026-05-12

### Architectural Notes
- `offline_picks` queue entry `id` format is `${userId}:${bandId}:<crypto-uuid>` — unique even for repeated same-band toggles
- `flushPending()` for announcements replaces draft IDs (crypto.randomUUID client-side) with server-assigned IDs on successful flush
- `handle_new_user()` uses `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` to handle re-run (e.g., test user recreation) without overwriting existing roles (except for godlike email)
- Service Worker `CacheFirst` for cross-origin images requires `cacheableResponse: { statuses: [0, 200] }` to cache opaque CORS responses
- Reading paths provide role-based navigation into the wiki, reducing onboarding time from 2–3 days to 30 min–3 hours

---

## 2026-05-11 (Badge Asset Wiring)

### Added
- Wired five badge assets into `BADGES`: `bbq-king-2026`, `dreamer`, `jagger-king`, `live-beast`, and `total-kaput-2026`.
- Added badge localization keys for Brazilian Portuguese, English, Spanish, and German.

### Changed
- Updated the badge inventory to 28 active badges and documented `dreamer` as a persisted 30-pick milestone.
- Updated the `dreamer` badge display copy to use the "I'm Tripping" / "Tô doidão" concept across locales.
- Removed the unused `badge_camping_mob.png` test asset from the active badge asset folder.

### Architectural Notes
- `dreamer` uses the existing `persist: true` badge mechanism so it remains earned after the user later changes picks.
- The new honor badges use the existing `assigned` condition and godlike assignment flow.

## 2026-05-11 (Phase 13.B)

### Added (User Flows)
- **flows/live-now.md** — Live band display: time model (festival-local CEST), current/next band selection algorithm, conflict severity (hard >15min / soft ≤15min), crew grouping (by band → camping → metal place → lost), presence states (camping, metal place time window, auto-checkout), godlike test mode (splice virtual band at now), realtime presence updates (~3s), edge cases (band ends at now, multiple picks both current, timezone wrapping, stale offline state), performance memoization, known limitations (hard-coded CEST, no auto-seen tracking), future improvements

---

## 2026-05-11 (Phase 13.A)

### Added (User Flows)
- **flows/announcements.md** — Complete post lifecycle: happy path (online), offline queueing & flushing, realtime propagation to other users, soft-delete with RLS enforcement, moderation (manager/godlike), edge cases (post-delete race, blocked posters, flaky network, retry idempotency), known issues (blocked poster RLS missing, no dedup on retry), future improvements

---

## 2026-05-11 (Continued)

### Added (Features & Systems)
- **badges.md** — Badge system: 22+ condition types (Wacken history, profile, arrival, band picks/seen, location, assigned), current 30 badges, step-by-step guide to add new badges, localization (4 languages), testing patterns, edge cases, persist vs. conditional badge semantics

### Architectural Discoveries
- IndexedDB has 13 object stores (data + queues + config)
- Queue stores are separate from data stores (offline_picks distinct from user_picks)
- Deduplication groups by (user_id, band_id) and keeps only last action
- Realtime subscriptions are per-hook and clean up on unmount
- Auth session persisted to IndexedDB via custom Supabase storage adapter
- Event emitters (window events) used instead of Redux/Context for state updates
- BandSync runs once on init, not re-run on reconnect (band list immutable)
- Cache version bump wiped all local data, used for lineup invalidation
- Each repository exposes a public interface with sync + queue flush methods
- Workbox caching strategy: NetworkFirst for Supabase, CacheFirst for band images

### Structure
- `/flows/` folder created for user flow documentation
- `/decisions/` folder created for architectural decision records
- Template established for flow documents (Purpose, Trigger, Happy Path, Offline Behavior, Sync Behavior, Source Files, Diagrams, Edge Cases)

---

## 2026-05-11 (Initial Session)

### Added (Core Architecture)
- **index.md** — Navigation hub, system diagram, architecture principles, reading order
- **architecture.md** — 4-layer design, data flows (online/offline/realtime), repositories, offline behavior, sync mechanisms
- **domain-model.md** — Entities (User, Band, UserPick, UserPresence, Announcement, etc.), relationships, business rules by role
- **offline-first.md** — Golden rule (IDB primary), queue design, deduplication mechanics, example lifetimes, guarantees per data type, Service Worker caching
